Prachi Chirkhe: Data Alchemist & Adventure Seeker ‍♀️‍♀️⛰️

Excel sheets my spellbook , Python my wand 🪄, beaches my happy place ️. 
I'm Prachi, a data analyst by day and a data science enthusiast by...well, every other waking moment.

My tools of the trade:
  Data wrangling: SQL, Python (pandas, numpy, you name it)
  Visual alchemy: Power BI, Tableau, Google Data Studio - I turn numbers into eye candy
  Excel master: Pivot tables, formulas, macros - spreadsheets cower at my fingertips
  
But wait, there's more! When I'm not wrangling data, you'll find me:

Headstand hero: Yoga keeps my mind and body limber ‍♀️, ready for any data contortion.
Chess grandmaster (in my head): Checkmating opponents (mostly myself) is my intellectual foreplay ♟️
Shuttlecock slayer: Badminton? More like birdie beatdown . My smashes are legendary (or at least that's what I tell myself).
Football fanatic: Go team! ⚽ (As long as they're not playing spreadsheets).
Music maestro: Shower singer extraordinaire , air guitar aficionado .
Mermaid in the making: Pools, oceans, anything with waves - I'm there, fins twitching ‍♀️
Travel bug? Check. My soul craves quiet beaches ️, hidden waterfalls ️, and mountain vistas  that make my Excel charts look puny. I'm always plotting my next escape ✈️, map in hand, data analysis on hold (temporarily, of course).

So, what are you waiting for?

Star my repos: Be my data-loving sidekick!
Fork and contribute: Let's make these analyses sing (or at least chart beautifully)
Drop a line: We can chat about data, travel, or the existential angst of pivot tables
Just remember: Excel may be my playground, but the world is my data set . Join me on this adventure, and let's see what insights we can uncover together! ✨

P.S. Don't be surprised if you find a stray chess piece ♟️ or a badminton birdie  hanging around. They're my debugging mascots, and they're pretty good at spotting outliers.
